# Showcase

This directory includes an [example sketch](./embedded_chess_piece/embedded_chess_piece.ino) to demonstrate the *Embedded Chess Piece* project. A white pawn and a black queen are simulated and move on the chess board. For more information, see the [documentation](https://github.com/embedded-chess/doc/releases) (German only).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Load the [`beacon.ino`](../beacon/beacon.ino) sketch on another dezibot to guide the rotation procedure!

Two printable example chess boards for the simulated chess pieces can be found in the `doc` repository under [`assets/showcase_boards.pdf`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/embedded-chess/doc/refs/heads/main/assets/showcase_boards.pdf).
