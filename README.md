# Embedded Chess Pieces

This repository contains our project for the module C999.1 "Software Development for Embedded Systems" lectured by [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Jens Wagner](https://fim.htwk-leipzig.de/fakultaet/personen/professorinnen-und-professoren/jens-wagner/). We call it *Embedded Chess Pieces*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project is still under development. This note will be removed once the project is submitted.


## Idea

The idea is to place a Dezibot 4 on a chess board and assign a chess piece to it. The user can select which piece the robot represents and how it should move via a wireless connection. The selected figure shall be displayed on the built-in display. If there is time, the move shall be validated first and be shown via the LEDs.


## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follows. All libraries we developed (further) are stored in [`libraries`](./libraries/). This includes changes to the [`Dezibot` library](./libraries/Dezibot/) and the completely newly developed [`EmbeddedChessPieces` library](./libraries/EmbeddedChessPieces/). The latter one includes project specific code that is not generally sensible to add to the Dezibot library.

In `src` you can find example use cases for our project. This includes Arduino sketches we developed to test our library developments as well as the heart of this project â€“ the code to run our project.
